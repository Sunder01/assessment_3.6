to calculate the number of data nodes 
total storage requirement = 3+1 * 600 = 2400
so n = 2400/7 = 343 data nodes needed


2. yes the user can read the data. for example if a block can have 100 mb of data if first block is completed in writing then that 
block is visible only the current writing block is not visible to the user for read during writing 500mb
